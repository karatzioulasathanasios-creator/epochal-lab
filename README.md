# Epochal Lab

Epochal Lab is a deterministic operational companion illustrating the internal logic of
epochal accessibility as developed in the accompanying theoretical manuscripts.

## Scope

This repository provides a static, endpoint-only operational illustration.
It introduces no new physical assumptions, models, simulations, or results.

The Epochal Lab is **not** a software tool, simulation, or predictive framework.
It plays no role in validation or verification of the theoretical results.

## Relationship to the Papers

All scientific claims are contained entirely within the peer-reviewed manuscripts.
This repository exists solely to make the operational structure transparent.

## Usage

The content may be viewed directly in a web browser.
No installation, execution, or external dependencies are required.

## Status

This repository is provided as-is, without versioning, releases, or active development.
