# Epochal Lab — Operational Companion

Epochal Lab is a deterministic, endpoint-only operational companion to a peer-reviewed framework
for epochal accessibility on a fixed cosmic timeline.

This repository introduces **no new physical assumptions, no new theoretical results, and no
independent scientific claims**. Its sole purpose is to provide transparent, operational
illustrations of concepts defined in the associated papers.

---

## What this repository is

- An **operational companion** to published theoretical work.
- A collection of **deterministic, endpoint-only demonstrators** based on a fixed ordering
  parameter τ.
- A **non-claim-bearing resource** provided for transparency and inspection.
- A static, self-contained HTML implementation (no backend, no data collection).

---

## What this repository is not

Epochal Lab is **not**:

- a physical simulation,
- a predictive or generative model,
- a cosmological or gravitational model,
- a theory of time or causality,
- a learning system or AI framework,
- an experimental apparatus,
- a software result or standalone contribution.

No inference, forecasting, calibration, optimization, synchronization, or temporal dynamics
are performed.

## Relationship to the published papers

Epochal Lab is hierarchically subordinate to the following three papers:

### Paper 1 — Foundational framework
**Epochal Accessibility and Optimal Traversal on the Cosmic Timeline**  
Athanasios Karatzioulas, 2025

Introduces the formal definition of normalized cosmic ordering, clock-dependent accessibility,
epochal structure, traversal cost, and optimality principles.

---

### Paper 2 — Operational realization
**Operational Realization of Epochal Accessibility on the Cosmic Timeline**  
Athanasios Karatzioulas, 2025

Demonstrates that the abstract framework admits a fully specified, deterministic, endpoint-only
operational realization without introducing new assumptions or dynamics.

---

### Paper 3 — Application frameworks
**Operational Application Frameworks Induced by Epochal Accessibility**  
Athanasios Karatzioulas, 2025

Examines navigation, decision zoning, ranking, and synchronization layers that arise
deterministically from the framework.

---

Epochal Lab serves as a **shared operational reference** across all three works.
No claim in any paper depends on inspection of this repository.

---

## Role of Epochal Lab

The Epochal Lab provides:

- ordering-based recall proxies,
- clock comparison under channel separation,
- accessibility-based navigation and ranking,
- epochal decision feasibility zones,
- constrained synchronization views.

All evaluations are:
- deterministic,
- endpoint-only,
- channel-separated,
- path-independent.

The Lab does not extend, validate, or test the theory.
It only demonstrates its operational coherence.

## How to view

## Citation and disclaimer

If referencing the theoretical framework, please cite the relevant papers listed above.
This repository itself should **not** be cited as an independent scientific contribution.

Readers may safely ignore this repository without loss of completeness or correctness
in the interpretation of the associated papers.
